# Proposed NIWA Style for R Shiny Applications


NIWA has a [default style guide])(https://styles.niwa.co.nz/, created in conjunction with communications team and IT systems development but the repo I found for R Shiny Apps still used the old logo so I forked NIWA's [shiny_styleguide](https://github.com/niwa/shiny-styleguide) and use some basic css to copy NIWA's current style.


The file `style.css` contains basic css code for some of the elements defined in `ui.R`.

Here's a screen shot of the a basic R Shiny app with my updated NIWA style.
